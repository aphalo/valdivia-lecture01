# Introductions

## Introductions: Who are we?

- Name
- Where you come from
- Field of study
- Why are you interested in the course?
- _etc._

# Aims of design of experiments

## Discussion

- Why is design of experiments a sub-discipline of Statistics?

- What do we aim at when we design an experiment?

- What could be the differences between design and planning of experiments?

- After this talk, you will design some experiments working in groups.

## The aims of design of experiments

**Validity**

- The assumptions needed for a valid data analysis must be fulfilled.

**Efficiency**

- The amount and quality of information obtained with a given effort should be maximized.

**Range of validity**

- The data obtained should be representative for the whole scope of intended use of the acquired information (spatial, temporal, genotypic `space').

## Validity: Assumptions

- Assumptions are never "TRUE", but they can sometimes be close enough to being fulfilled.
- All data analysis procedures depend on some assumptions.
- Some assumptions are fundamental.
- Additional assumptions may be required by certain procedures for data analysis.
- The fewer assumptions made, the more robust are the conclusions obtained.

## Why is bias a problem?

- Bias can be completely confounded with treatment effects.
- It cannot be measured within an experiment and it cannot be diagnosed based on the collected data.
- There is no statistical procedure that can rescue or even identify this problem.
- Bias due to lack of randomization or due to _"subjective randomization"_ or systematic measuring protocols results in _biased (bad) data_ leading to _wrong conclusions_ and **unrepeatable experiments**!

## Avoiding bias

- Randomization of treatment assignment.
- Randomization of measurement sequences.
- Randomization of operator assignment.
- When source of variation is known using restricted randomization (blocks)...
- ... or quantifying the external cause of the variation for each observation (covariates).

## Detecting accidental bias

- Most effective way is to have the whole study replicated independently by other labs.
- We can also go quite far by replication in time by same research group if care is taken so that the same "hidden" disturbances are not likely to repeat.

## Irreproducibility of research results

- Sure ways of compromising reproducibility:
    * consider interdependent observations as replicates ("pseudo-replication"),
    * add replicates until effects are significant,
    * delete apparent outliers until significance is reached ("cherry picking"),
    * choose for publication the "best" replicate from a series of replications of an experiment ("cherry picking"),
    * not reporting methods in detail, including problems encountered,
    * making assumptions that are not tenable or are not validated.
- this is because statistical tests and _p_-values they return are invalidated by bias.

## Reproducibility of research results

- Good ways of avoiding gross irreproducibility:
    * keep in mind that objective decision-making is not automatic.
    * avoid "wanting" a certain outcome (not getting in love with an idea).
    * use valid designs and protocols in your experiments.
    * understand the principles of experimental design and always follow them (avoid short cuts).

# Simulated experiments

## Introduction

- We will use demonstrations that run interactively through a web browser interface. 
- Today we will _play_ with simulated experiments.
- Data are simulated by drawing random samples from the Normal distribution.

## How do sampled data look as population parameters change?

In these simulations:

- The mean of the Control distribution is kept at zero.
- You can choose the value of the mean for Treatment.
- You can choose the value of the standard deviation used.
- You can choose the size of samples ($\approx$ number of replicates).
- The plot shows: simulated observations as rug plots on the $x$ axis, _sample_ 
  empirical distributions and the _population_ means as blue vertical lines.
- **To do:** Run the simulation multiple times for each set of values you set for the
  population parameters.

## Simulation experiment: data

```{r sampling, cache=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("mean_treat", label = "Mean of 'Treatment':",
              choices = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100), selected = 10),
  
  selectInput("n_replicates", label = "Number of replicates:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 40, 100, 1000, 10000), selected = 100),
  
  sliderInput("sd_adjust", label = "Standard deviation:",
              min = 0, max = 10, value = 1, step = 0.2),
  
  actionButton("refresh", "New simulation")
  
)

generate_samples <- function() {
  num_replicates <- as.numeric(input$n_replicates)
  num_mean <- as.numeric(input$mean_treat)
  y <- c(rnorm(n = num_replicates, mean = 0, sd = input$sd_adjust),
         rnorm(n = num_replicates, mean = num_mean, sd = input$sd_adjust))
  group <- factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), rep(num_replicates, 2)))
  data.frame(y, group)
} 

renderPlot({
  ggplot(generate_samples(), aes(y, colour = group)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = c(0, as.numeric(input$mean_treat)), 
               linetype = "dotted", color = "blue") +
    geom_rug() +
    geom_density(fill = NA) +
    annotate(x = 1.5, y = 0, label = input$refresh, alpha = 0, geom = "text") +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = function(x) {x + (diff(x) * 0.1) * c(-1,1)}) +
    theme_bw(20)
})
```

## Sample summaries (mean and standard deviation)

- **To do:** For each condition run **15** or more simulations.
    * observe how the sample mean and sd change when you:
- Keep constant the standard deviation of the populations sampled.
    * change the Treatment effect size.
- Keep the Treatment effect size constant.
    * change the standard deviation of the populations sampled.
- Keep the Treatment effect size and the standard deviation constant.
    * change number of replicates.

## Simulation experiment: sample summaries

```{r summaries, cache=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("mean_treat1", label = "Mean of 'Treatment':",
              choices = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100), selected = 1),
  
  selectInput("n_replicates1", label = "Number of replicates:",
              choices = c(3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, 1000, 10000), selected = 10),
  
  sliderInput("sd_adjust1", label = "Standard deviation:",
              min = 0, max = 10, value = 1, step = 0.2),
  
  checkboxInput("disp_ttest", label = "t-test", value = FALSE),
  
  actionButton("refresh1", "New simulation")
  
)

renderPrint({
  num_replicates <- as.numeric(input$n_replicates1)
  num_mean <- as.numeric(input$mean_treat1)
  y <- c(rnorm(n = num_replicates, mean = 0, sd = input$sd_adjust1),
         rnorm(n = num_replicates, mean = num_mean, sd = input$sd_adjust1))
  group <- factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), rep(num_replicates, 2)))
  df <- data.frame(y, group)
  if (input$disp_ttest) {
    t.test(y ~ group, data = df)
  } else {
    data.frame(group = c("Control", "Treatment"),
               n = num_replicates,
               pop.mean = c(0, num_mean),
               samp.mean = signif(c(mean(df[df$group == "Control", "y"]),
                                    mean(df[df$group == "Treatment", "y"])), 3),
               pop.sd = input$sd_adjust1,
               samp.sd = signif(c(sd(df[df$group == "Control", "y"]),
                                  sd(df[df$group == "Treatment", "y"])), 3),
               simulation = rep(input$refresh1[1], 2)
    )
  }
})

```

## Simulation experiment: ANOVA

- **To do:** For each condition run **15** or more simulations.
    * consider if a non-significant _p_-value demonstrate lack of treatment effect or not.
- Keep the Treatment effect size constant.
    * change number of replicates and see how this affects the _p_-value and the plotted standard error.
- Keep the Treatment effect size constant.
    * change the standard deviation of the populations sampled.
    
- What can you conclude from a significant _p_-value?
- Can you conclude something more than "significant effect"?

## Simulation experiment: ANOVA

```{r replication, cache=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("mean_treat2", label = "Mean of 'Treatment':",
              choices = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100), selected = 1),

              min = 0, max = 10, value = 1, step = 0.2),

generate_data <- function() {
  num_replicates <- as.numeric(input$n_replicates2)

  y <- c(rnorm(n = num_replicates, mean = 0, sd = input$sd_adjust2),
         rnorm(n = num_replicates, mean = num_mean, sd = input$sd_adjust2))
  x <- factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), rep(num_replicates, 2)))
  data.frame(y, x)
}

  ggplot(generate_data(), aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_se", color = "red") +

## Simulation experiment: linear regression

- **To do:** For each condition run **15** or more simulations.
    * observe how statistical significance and $R^2$ very when you:
- Keep constant the standard deviation of the populations sampled.
    * change the slope size.
    * change the intercept size.
- Keep the slope size constant.
    * change the standard deviation of the populations sampled.
- Keep the Treatment effect size and the standard deviation constant.
    * change number of replicates.
